## How do I read this data?

The best way is with WildRank where you can upload a zip archive of the results using the "Transfer Raw Data" page. Otherwise, the data is all in JSON, easily parsable with most programming languages. The results are all stored by match-team as key-value pairs. Cycles are stored as a list of recuring pairs.
