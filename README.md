# 2022_scouting_data

WildRank scouting data collected during our 2022 Rapid React competitions.

## What is WildRank?

[WildRank](https://github.com/wildstang/wildrank) is our new scouting app for the 2022 season. For the Central Illinois Regional we used version 1.1.0.

## How do I read this data?

The best way is with WildRank where you can upload a zip archive of the results using the "Transfer Raw Data" page. Otherwise, the data is all in JSON, easily parsable with most programming languages. The results are all store by match-team as key value pairs. Cycles are stored as a list of recuring pairs.
